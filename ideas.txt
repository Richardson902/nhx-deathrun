update running model

instead of having a key for toggling third person, maybe have it in the game menu to avoid all the reload issues
or could fix them

if not first person, adjust the footstep location, shooting location, and camera position

since I can't fix shooting around walls, just make it so whenever a player enters an end room they are forced out of third person.

fix reload animations when switching to third person

add check for which weapon when zooming in in third person and adjust times.
